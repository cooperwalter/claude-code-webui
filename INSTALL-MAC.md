# üçé Easy Installation Guide for Mac Users

This guide will help you install and run Claude Code Web UI on your Mac in just a few minutes!

## üìã What You Need

### For Regular Users (Pre-built Binary)
1. **A Mac computer** (preferably with Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
2. **Claude CLI installed** - The ONLY dependency!
   - Visit <https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code>
   - Follow their installation instructions
   - Run `claude auth` to log in

**That's it!** The pre-built binary includes everything else:
- ‚úÖ Backend server (Deno runtime included)
- ‚úÖ Frontend interface (pre-built and bundled)
- ‚úÖ All necessary libraries and components

**You do NOT need**: Node.js, npm, Deno, or any other development tools!

### For Developers (Running from Source)
If you want to modify the code or contribute to development, see our [Developer Installation Guide](#developer-installation) at the bottom of this page.

## üöÄ Quick Install (Recommended)

We've created a simple script that does everything for you!

### Step 1: Download the installer

Open Terminal (you can find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and run:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cooperwalter/claude-code-webui/main/install-and-run-mac.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the installer

```bash
bash install-and-run-mac.sh
```

The script will:

- ‚úÖ Check if Claude CLI is installed
- ‚úÖ Install ngrok for easy access
- ‚úÖ Download Claude Code Web UI
- ‚úÖ Set everything up in /Applications
- ‚úÖ Create a desktop shortcut
- ‚úÖ Automatically start the app with ngrok
- ‚úÖ Give you a shareable HTTPS URL

## üéØ Using Claude Code Web UI

### Starting the Application

After installation, you can start Claude Code Web UI by:

1. **Double-clicking** the "Claude Code Web UI" alias on your desktop
2. **Or** opening Terminal and running:
   ```bash
   /Applications/ClaudeCodeWebUI/start-claude-webui.command
   ```

### What to Expect

1. The installer runs automatically (no prompts unless needed)
2. Ngrok starts and generates a friendly HTTPS URL
3. The URL is copied to your clipboard automatically
4. You'll see something like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
5. Share this URL with anyone - no IP addresses needed!
6. Claude runs in READ-ONLY mode by default (safer)

### Stopping the Application

To stop Claude Code Web UI:

- Close the Terminal window that's running the server
- Or press `Ctrl+C` in the Terminal window

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Claude CLI not found"

- You need to install Claude CLI first
- Visit: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code
- After installing, run the script again

### "Permission denied"

- Make sure you're running the script with `bash` as shown above
- If issues persist, try: `chmod +x install-and-run-mac.sh`

### Browser doesn't open automatically

- Manually open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8999`

### Port 8999 is already in use

- Another application is using port 8999
- Stop that application or wait a moment and try again

## üì± Universal Access with Ngrok

Claude Code Web UI uses ngrok to provide easy access from anywhere!

### How It Works:

1. **Automatic Setup**: The installer configures everything for you
2. **Friendly URL**: You get a URL like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
3. **Share Anywhere**: Works from any device, any network
4. **Secure**: HTTPS encryption built-in

### Read-Only Mode (Default)

For safety, Claude runs in read-only mode by default:

**Claude CAN:**
- ‚úÖ Read any files
- ‚úÖ Search code with grep, find, etc.
- ‚úÖ Run safe bash commands (ls, cat, git status, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Analyze and understand your codebase

**Claude CANNOT:**
- ‚ùå Modify or delete files
- ‚ùå Run dangerous commands
- ‚ùå Make system changes

### Full Permissions Mode

If you need Claude to modify files:
```bash
/Applications/ClaudeCodeWebUI/start-full-permissions.command
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution - allows file modifications!
